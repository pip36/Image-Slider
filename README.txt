A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/pip36/pen/wdWYqr.

 This is a simple JQuery looping image slider. 

To add images just add them to the list enclosed in <li> tags, the javascript will take care of the rest.

To adjust positioning of the slider, add css to the '.slider' class. Width value can be changed and will resize images, keeping their aspect ratio. The height value will set the height of the container div without affecting the image, so it may cause clipping off the bottom of tall images.

To adjust length of time on each image, alter the number in the last line of javascript (setInterval), smaller values for less time.
